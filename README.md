### About

This project is a fan-made port of the Antimatter Dimensions game to linux.

It was created by me for a friend who wants to play the game on his linux machine. **ALL CREDIT FOR THE GAME GOES TO** [IvarK](https://github.com/IvarK/IvarK.github.io/)!

### Where are the Downloads?

Prebuild binaries for x86_64, aarch64 and armhf can be found in the releases section.

### Building it yourself

You will have to clone the repository first:

`git clone https://github.com/iAmInActions/antimatter-for-linux`

You also need to have node.js and npm installed.

Now simply run

`chmod +x build.sh && ./build.sh`

to build the game.

**Note:**

If you only want the binaries and do not want to keep any of the other files, pass the `-clean` argument.
